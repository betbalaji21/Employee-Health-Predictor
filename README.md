# Enhancing Workplace Wellness
In this capstone project, I tackled the problem of addressing the health and well-being of employees at XYZ Technical Solutions. The objective was to develop a predictive model that identifies employees in need of medical treatment, allowing the company to design targeted wellness programs and improve overall employee health and productivity. # Machine Learning algoridham used 1] Logistic Regression 2] Decission Tree 3] Random Forest 4] KNeighborsClassifier 5] support vector machines (SVM) 6] AdaBoost By applying various types of models, I aimed to maximize the predictive accuracy and F1 score to improve the overall performance of the final solution. 
# Conclusion
After carefully analysing and comparing multiple models, I found that the random forest algorithm performed the best for this problem. It had higher accuracy of 87% and F1 score of 88% compared to other models. In conclusion, this capstone project successfully addressed the health and well-being concerns of employees at XYZ Technical Solutions. By developing a predictive model that identifies employees in need of medical treatment and able to provide valuable insights and recommendations to improve their overall health and productivity.
